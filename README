Literate is an engine for inline specs (tests) in your Ruby code. 

EXAMPLE

  spec "Box says custom message when instantiated with an argument" do 
    Box.new("Hi!").say.should == "Hi!"
  end

  class Box
    def initialize(msg = "Hello, world!")
      @msg = msg
    end
    def say
      @msg.freeze
    end
  end

See & run more examples in the /examples folder.

HOW TO RUN

Literate is tested with itself. Pretty cool, huh?
Simply run `ruby lib/literate.rb` to test the engine.
